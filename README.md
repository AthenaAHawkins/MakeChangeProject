#MakeChangeProject 

## Overview
My program is probably more simple than others, and i'm not sure it is as "dry" as it should be. However, it uses 
the set values of each dollar and coin amount in a loop. The total value that is needed to be returned will be fed through the loop. 
As it goes through each phase, the amount of each value will be removed from the total change and then move on to 
the next currency. As each currency is fed through the loop, the loop will add that to the total count for that currency
resulting in the amount of bills or coins due for each. 
It has conditions set for each situation, if the amount given is too much, too little, or the exact amount and 
is set to print a message for each.

## Lessons Learned
- I think one of the biggest things I grasped from this was, never trust doubles. Like just don't do it.
Though in all actuality it was good to be able to build a code from scratch and go through the process of trouble shooting. 
I had to go through multiple different versions before I found one that fit what I needed, but along the way I was able to 
try out various methods that we have used in drills but perhaps never necessarily stuck. 
Learning how to truncate was equally as important and figure out how to actually implement that. I still feel 
that I will need more practice to feel comfortable but overall I am able to grasp the concept easier now.
